I recently discovered an application called [Heynote](https://heynote.com/) and I think it is a great tool for developers.

It is a note-taking application that allows you to quickly jot down notes, code snippets, and other information. While it is very simple, it offers a few very useful features, such as block-based editing, syntax highlighting, and markdown support, which are all very useful features for developers. I used to use Sublime Text to jot down notes and code snippets, but Heynote is definitely a better tool for lightweight note-taking.
